The BeerButtons web app is designed for a user to select a brew based on the color and vessel types. It utilizes a MIT liscensed Dropdown menu from bit located at https://bitsrc.io/semantic-org/semantic-ui-react/dropdown?example=5c6ddc24df8d4d001421f6c7 for making user selections. While trying to incorporate Redux and failing I decided to use call back methods to link the users selections to the appropriate images. If you have a problem running the app I do have it hosted on my webpage @ https://ghtapps.com/assignment/proj1/public/
